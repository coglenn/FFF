                <p>Week 5:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Teteo- One loss won't keep a good yeti down.</li><br>
                    <li>Bryan(up)- Consistency beats talent when talent fails to be consistent.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Andrew(down)- Only two players scoring in double digits, one being a kicker. A showing for the record books. The biggest shit records that is! </li><br>
                    <li>Jake- A solid showing lead by the Chubba-chubba Choo-choo train.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Zack- Big cat lost its roar this week, but consistent output and faith in a good week 5 keep him locked in. </li><br>
                    <li>Sam(up)- Pulling victory from what appeared to be the jaws of defeat is deserving of moving up.</li><br>
                    <li>Colt(down) - Mental midget drops one against the underdog.</li><br>
                    <li>Ethan(up)- "Won A Couple" is an apt new moniker for Ethan's organization. The loss of Cordarrelle may force him to change it for week 5. </li><br>
                    <li>Jason(up)- Ekeler, Jacobs, and Reek with a group pop off this week to get Jason out of his rut. God help us if his tight end ever decides to show up.</li><br>
                    <li>Kyler(down)- Man down. Press F to pay respects.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Caleb- Caleb has been able to increase his weekly score every single week and it finally paid off. A roster shakeup trade could make that prospect even more exciting. He will need another win before making the move up. </li><br>
                    <img src="../static/mtndew.png" id="dew"><h2>SHITTER OF THE WEEK</h2><br>
                    <li>Josh - If Josh can make this season turn around I think he will look to use some of his winnings on an alarm clock. An early morning Sunday out for Kamara just before the 6.30 am London game sunk his chances before the sun had even crested the horizon. If there is some silver lining to be it is that this week marks Josh's highest point total for the year, even higher had he been able to slot in a warm body for Kamara. While the beginning of the season has been historically bad for Ragz, there remains several bottom feeders at or near his record who could provide an opening to reaching up towards the winning column as we move towards the middle of the fantasy regular season.</li><br>

                <p>Week 4:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Teteo- God squad is coming to your town, and they’re gonna fuck you up.</li><br>
                    <li>Andrew(up)- Consistent production top to bottom. Like a well oiled fantasy machine.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Bryan(down)- A down week, but a bounce back is in order with a fresh new trade piece. </li><br>
                    <li>Jake(down)- Both gods showed up. Unfortunately no one else did.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Zack(up)- A decent showing amongst a down week for the league. But his depth has shined bright this week. </li><br>
                    <li>Colt(up)- A solid comeback after last week’s loss. Colt needs to keep it up to stay with the upper tier of the league.</li><br>
                    <li>Sam(down) - Adding insult to injury, Sam’s star Swift will be out of commission. Can he ride the backup to glory?</li><br>
                    <li>Kyler- A low scoring contest for both teams is bad enough, but the spirit can break when you’ve lost to a team like Caleb’s. </li><br>
                    <li>Ethan(up)- Fought through a running back injury game and came out clean. Khalil is now ride or die.</li><br>
                    <li>Jason(down)- Cry now, cry later.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Caleb- A moral and an actual victory. Big moves need to be made and fingers need to be crossed to keep the flame alive though. </li><br>
                    <img src="../static/mtndew.png" id="dew"><h2>SHITTER OF THE WEEK</h2><br>
                    <li>Josh - Week 2 on the shit-list. I know it’s dark down here. I know it’s scary. Little to eat or drink. Constant attacks on your fantasy football acumen. But strengthen yourself. Let the pressure of the whole league standing on your head form you into a diamond. New week, new players, new opponent. What’s the worst that can happen? You’re already at rock bottom.</li><br>
                    </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="rankings" id="week3">
                <p>Week 3:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Teteo(up)- Teteo has crafted the dream squad. Take notes.</li><br>
                    <li>Bryan(up)- Consistent excellence. He just gets the job done.</li><br>
                    <li>Jake(up)- Coming back strong after a week one loss. Jake is building steam.</li><br>
                    <li>Colt(down)- A week 2 disappointment, but Colt has tasted the good life. He’ll be wanting more.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Andrew- Did what it took to get the victory. But he can’t expect to do the same against a contender.</li><br>
                    <li>Sam(down)- Losing to the previous week’s shitlicker after a promising week one leads to a big demotion. *<br><br>*editors note, since the initial writing of the rankings Sam was able to barely win.</li><br>
                    <li>Zack(up) - A middling week, but a win all the same. We will need to see some improvement moving forward.</li><br>
                    <li>Kyler(down)- Disappointment after a string opening showing last week. Is there trouble in the house of the running back?</li><br>
                    <li>Jason(up)- The ass shaking gifs are back. But Josh Jacobs is not, thank god.</li><br>
                    <li>Ethan(up) - Any week under 100 is a massive blow to the ego and requires a hard look at the roster. Luckily for Ethan the league has no shortage of bottom dwellers to rise above.</li><br>
                    <li>Caleb(up)- Crowned “Worst Roster in The League” by popular opinion, Caleb did little to prove doubters wrong. Fortunately for him he was able to pull himself from the septic tank this week fashioning another teams bloated corpse below him as a sort of human life raft…</li><br>
                    <img src="../static/mtndew.png" id="dew"><h2>SHITTER OF THE WEEK</h2><br>
                    <li>Josh(down) - Really, really not great man. Two weeks in a row to open the new season with sub 90 point scoring. Not only that but doing so in the face of a true god-like opponent. Like if David and Goliath ended with Goliath using David’s skinned flesh as a doormat after shooting him in the face with a shotgun. I think the Bible would be cooler if that happened, but in this case Josh’s loss is pitiable. Get that trade machine up and running and be ready to lay down some fat FAAB stacks cuz this team needs a reset asap. </li><br>

            <div class="rankings" id="week2">
                <p>Week 2:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Sam(up)- Five QB interceptions and Two running back heroes equals WIN.</li><br>
                    <li>Colt(up)- Usually by this point colt has renounced religion and all hope.</li><br>
                    <li>Bryan(up)- A win is a win. Even if it's Caleb.</li><br>
                    <li>Kyler(up)- Second highest scorer, fourth in power rankings. Possible conspiracy against this maverick owner?</li><br>
                    <li>Andrew(up)- If this guy ever learns who to play off his bench we are all fucked.</li><br>
                    <li>Jake(up)- Two gods, one L.</li><br>
                    <li>Zack - Josh Allen can only do so much to try and save this self inflicted starter decision disaster.</li><br>
                    <li>Ethan(up)- Not last!</li><br>
                    <li>Teteo(down)- Teteo's first two picks may have been duds, but the entire Jets offense is ready to take this team to the next level.</li><br>
                    <li>Jason - It's the Pitts.</li><br>
                    <li>Josh(down)- Losing by one point is always a tragedy. Knowing that if you had started no one in the flex and you would have won? Enough to crush a man's soul.</li><br>
                    <img src="../static/mtndew.png" id="dew"><h2>SHITTER OF THE WEEK</h2><br>
                    <li>Caleb - 9 players, not even 80 points. You'd better be thanking your lucky stars that the Browns so happily employ human scum because without Kareem Hunt we would have tossed the season away and just assigned you last place punishment in week 1. Najee dead, Etienne already usurped by James Robinson, Prescott fucked, CeeDee bust, Kittle made of glass. Only one option left. Jamaal Williams SZN. </li><br>
